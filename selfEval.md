# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
> I feel proud of how I explained the array and string methods. I feel that if someone read my explanation on how to do them, they would understand how the function works.
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
> If you have code that is repeated throughout your program, you can reuse it using functions. You can also break code into smaller functions so that way you don't debug one giant chunk of code, but smaller functions that are working together.
